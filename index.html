// 1. Compare user's choice from the prompt to the value we're using for the computer's choice.
// Remember that for this iteration of the game the computer's choice is still hard coded to Bear.
// Create the logic to handle all nine (9) combinations of choices, even though the computer choice is hard coded.
// Since there are three (3) possible outcomes from nine (9) possible conditions, we partition the values.  (HINT: Hover over the word partition for a quick summary definition.)
// Here is how we partition our game values:
//       Conditions 1, 2, and 3 are partitioned to a "Tie"
//       Conditions 4, 5, and 6 are partitioned to User win.
//       Conditions 7, 8, and 9 are partitioned to a Computer win.
// 2. Determine game winner based on this set of game rules.  Use ONLY this game logic and no other.
//      Bear beats Ninja, Ninja beats Hunter, and Hunter beats Bear.  
// 3. Put together messages for the player that combine text and the values of the variables from the user input (concatenation).
// 4. Use the switch to determine the win / loss conditions.
// 5. Use an if..else tree to assign the correct message based on the win / loss conditions.
// 6. Requirements 4 & 5 are to support code maintainability.  See lecture recording for details.
// 7. Output the concatenated strings using two (2) different output methods: HTML and console.
// 8. As long as the HTML output is on three lines as shown, you are highly encouraged to cut loose with your CSS styling!
// 9. Fix all issues with last week's submission in this iteration.
